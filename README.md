## Notes

Install postgresql
`brew install postgres`

If there's a new version of postgres, just use the command: `brew postgresql-upgrade-database` to update the old **data**

Launch psql before starting the application (no brew services psql process need)
Start the db
`npm run start-db`
Start the api
`npm run server`
Start the client
`npm run serve`

The shell db connection string is:
`psql -U $username -d $database -W -h $host`

##Â Sequelize commands
`npx sequelize-cli init`

`npx sequelize-cli db:create`

`npx sequelize-cli db:drop`
